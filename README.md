This plugin adds to your server the ability to create your own SkyWars minigame. This is perfect copy of the plugin from a most popular server and it's fully custmizable! In this price you can create own maps with custom number of the players, own chest equipment, ultra chests, kits, global & normal signs and more! 
Plugin is compatible with most servers such as [Bukkit](https://bukkit.org), [Spigot](https://spigotmc.org), [PaperSpigot](https://paper.readthedocs.io/) 
and uses the Java 7 or later. If you like our project give us Star on GitHub and remember about review and stars on Spigot resource page.
